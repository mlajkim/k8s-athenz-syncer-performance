`k8s-athenz-syncer-performance` [^1] is a Kubernetes controller that syncs Athenz roles into Kubernetes RBAC, just like [Athenz/k8s-athenz-syncer](https://github.com/AthenZ/k8s-athenz-syncer), but in a more manual and educational way.

## Features

Operator `k8s-athenz-syncer-performance` creates the following when you simply create a namespace in your Kubernetes cluster:
- Athenz domain under certain parent domain (e.g., `eks.users`)
- Athenz roles under the created domain, that you can define in the config file
- Kubernetes RBAC Roles that correspond to the created Athenz roles, that you define in the config file

![Demo](./assets/01_create_ns.gif)

Operator `k8s-athenz-syncer-performance` periodically polls Athenz roles under certain parent domain (e.g., `eks.users`), and syncs the members of the Athenz roles into corresponding Kubernetes RBAC Roles.

![Demo](./assets/02_polling_athenz_roles.gif)

Operator `k8s-athenz-syncer-performance` makes sure that if you delete members from Athenz roles, the members are also removed from corresponding Kubernetes RBAC Roles.

Operator `k8s-athenz-syncer-performance` also syncs the members from registered Athenz groups into corresponding Kubernetes RBAC Roles.

## How to run locally

This operator requires the following:

- Running kubernetes cluster
- Running Athenz Server


### For those who want to run easy way

> [!TIP]
> If you know what you are doing, you can always skip this section go build your own way here: [Run locally](#run-locally)


The following command sets up:

- A simple test directory for clean start
- A local Kubernetes cluster using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Athenz server deployed into the local Kubernetes cluster using [Athenz Distribution](https://github.com/ctyano/athenz-distribution)
- Clones this project into the test directory & copy necessary certs and keys for Athenz admin user

```sh
brew install kind && kind create cluster

_tmp_dir=$(date +%y%m%d_%H%M%S_k8s_athenz_syncer_performance)
mkdir -p ~/test_dive/$_tmp_dir && cd ~/test_dive/$_tmp_dir

git clone https://github.com/ctyano/athenz-distribution.git athenz_distribution
make -C ./athenz_distribution clean-kubernetes-athenz deploy-kubernetes-athenz
```

Once the manifests above is done, set up ZMS server:

```sh
kubectl -n athenz port-forward deployment/athenz-ui 4443:4443 &
kubectl -n athenz port-forward deployment/athenz-ui 3000:3000 &
```

Clone this project, with copying necessary certs and keys for Athenz admin user:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlajkim/k8s-athenz-syncer-performance.git k8s_athenz_syncer_performance

cp ./athenz_distribution/certs/athenz_admin.cert.pem ./k8s_athenz_syncer_performance/certs/athenz_admin.cert.pem
cp ./athenz_distribution/keys/athenz_admin.private.pem ./k8s_athenz_syncer_performance/keys/athenz_admin.private.pem
```

Run the following command, and simply hit `Enter` keys with default values:

```sh
make -C ./k8s_athenz_syncer_performance run
```

### Run locally

> [!TIP]
> If you want to see running without thinking too much, check out: [For those who want to run easy way](#for-those-who-want-to-run-easy-way)

To run this operator locally, do the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlajkim/k8s-athenz-syncer-performance.git k8s_athenz_syncer && cd k8s_athenz_syncer
make run
```

## Limitations

This project is not production-ready, but it is more of the educational purpose to show how `k8s-athenz-syncer` works under the hood.

### No Delta Sync (Full Polling Only)

The current implementation fetches the full membership list from the Athenz ZMS API on every reconciliation loop. It does not utilize:

- caching
- Last-Modified headers
-  ETags

to fetch only the changes (delta), which would be inefficient at scale.

### No Concurrency Control

The controller processes items sequentially. In a production environment with thousands of namespaces, parallel processing (worker pools) would be necessary to reduce sync latency.

### Limited Error Handling & Backoff

While it relies on the default rate-limiting of controller-runtime, it lacks sophisticated error handling strategies like circuit breakers for the external ZMS API or differentiating between transient network errors and permanent configuration errors.

### No Custom Metrics

It does not export custom Prometheus metrics (e.g., athenz_sync_duration_seconds, athenz_api_errors_total), which are critical for monitoring the health and performance of the operator in production.

### No unit test

Only simple and manual testing is done so far. There is no unit test coverage for the reconciliation logic, Athenz API interactions, or RBAC role management.

### Athenz Domain/Role Cleanup

When a Kubernetes namespace is deleted, the corresponding Athenz domain and roles are not automatically cleaned up. In real world scenarios, maybe there could be business decision not to do so, but still it does not offer a feature to turn in on/off. In a certain production scenario, you would want to implement finalizers to ensure proper cleanup of Athenz resources when namespaces are removed.
